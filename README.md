# JSPR
Demo for the JSPR method in the paper "Gao, Q., Lim, S. and Jia, X., 2018. Hyperspectral Image Classification Using Joint Sparse Model and Discontinuity Preserving Relaxation. IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 15(1), pp.78-82". demo_IP is for Indian Pines data set, and demo_PU is for the Pavia University data set.

Pavia university is too large to upload, the user can download the data from http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php?title=Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes.
The "img" in the demo_PU is the original images with the size of 610x340x103, the "groundtruth" is the ground truth values of the dataset with the size of 610x340.
