# JSPR
Demo for the JSPR method 
Pavia university is too large to upload, the user can download the data from http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php?title=Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes.
The "img" in the demo_PU is the original images with the size of 610x340x103, the "groundtruth" is the ground truth values of the dataset with the size of 610x340.
